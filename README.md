## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]]

Educators often face many challenges in identifying the factors which make their lessons more engaging. Traditional methods of assessing student engagement and satisfaction in classrooms often rely on subjective observations by the educator, which may possibly fail to capture the nuances of the student’s expressions. Thus there needs to be more objective approaches to gauge students' involvement and satisfaction levels.
