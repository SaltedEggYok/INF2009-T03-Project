Found a speech emotion recognition model at https://github.com/MiteshPuthran/Speech-Emotion-Analyzer
Tested their inpyb file locally on my laptop and was able to get things working
This model is a CNN, and has already been trained with multiple layers

Found another model at https://github.com/MeidanGR/SpeechEmotionRecognition_Realtime/tree/main
Their model is a LSTM instead, but it is real time, instead of reading a file directly
Might be useful if we want to do real-time analysis, will keep it in consideration
Notably higher accuracy compared to the other one previously found

Tested 1st model's prediction on the Raspberry Pi, seems to be able to work fine
Able to take in recorded audio and have a result appear

Tested 2nd model's runtime and prediction, works fine. However as we have changed the structure of program,
the 1st model seems to be more suitable for our needs. Thus will continue working on taking and adapting the 1st
model into our application.
